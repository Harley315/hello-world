# hello-world
Aspiring Web Developer 
 and a recent Town Planning graduate who within a year of being in the industry have realised this is not where I want to be. I stumbled onto coding randomly well searching through some tech reviews on Youtube. I liked what I seen and a few months down the track I have been learning the basics of coding. I am looking into a Coding Bootcamp with Coders Academy in Brisbane, Australia. Exciting times ahead.
